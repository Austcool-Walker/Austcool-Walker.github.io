  I'm new to Ubuntu, and I don't know how to mount my iPhone.
  I would like to download iTunes, but I saw that USB doesn't work, but I just need to access to all my files and APP because would like to
  transfer APP from pc to iPhone.

    Is the phone jailbroken? – fakedad Aug 14 '16 at 1:19
    No it is not, fresh as new – Rizio A. Aug 14 '16 at 15:24
    As far as I know, there is no way to mount the iPhone's filesystem normally via USB on any OS. Moreover, I don't
    know of any applications for Ubuntu (or any Linux distro for that matter) that allow the syncing of apps to an iOS
    device. – fakedad Aug 14 '16 at 20:09
    You can try to run Windows in a virtual machine using VirtualBox, and manage apps via iTunes in the VM. – fakedad

    I read somewhere that it could work installing GKSU NAUTILUS...(honestly, dunno wtf it is), but it gave some
    error...and cannot download VirtualBox...do you have any link? – Rizio A. Aug 15 '16 at 1:10

  Evidently I was wrong about being able to mount an iPhone on Ubuntu. You can perform this
  using the following steps on yakkety. Note, you would need the device to be jailbroken in
  order to load apps onto the device this way, but this method will suffice for getting media
  from the device.
  Option 1: Using a script
  If you want to save yourself some time, you can download a script here to do most of the
  work of the process for you.
  Once downloaded, you will need to change the permisions so you can execute the script.
  Assuming you downloaded it with the default name, iphone_setup.sh , cd to the directory
  in which you downloaded the file and do
  chmod u+x iphone_setup.sh
  Convert the Windows line endings by doing
  ex -bsc '%!awk "{sub(/\r/,\"\")}1"' -cx iphone_setup.sh
  Then run the script with root privileges using
  sudo ./iphone_setup.sh
  This will complete all of Step 1 of the manual setup for you, as well as Step 3 and Step 4.
  You will then need to do Step 2 and Step 5 of the manual setup after the script finishes
  running.
  Option 2: Doing it manually
  Step 1: Installing the tools
  Before plugging in the iPhone, you will need to install the several programs to make it
  possible to mount the iPhone.

   Step 1.1: Installing several important tools with apt-get
   Do the following in the terminal to install a few packages that will be needed for any version
   of iOS.
    sudo apt-get install ideviceinstaller python-imobiledevice libimobiledevice-utils
    python-plist usbmuxd
   If you are connecting an iPhone with an iOS version before iOS 9, you can skip the remaining
   substeps of step 1 and instead just do the following:
    sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice6 libplist3 ifuse
   Step 1.2: Installing tools for building
   Use   apt-get    to install a few programs needed to build the programs in the following steps
    sudo apt-get install libtool autoconf automake
   Step 1.3: Installing libplist
   First, install the required dependencies for building      libplist . In order to do this, do the
   following:
    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev python-dev
   Then download the latest version of libplist from GitHub, and extract the contents of the
   zip file to some directory. For instance, if you are in the directory where you downloaded the
    libplist zip file, do unzip libplist-master.zip .
   You should now have a directory called "libplist-master" in the directory to which you
   extracted the libplist zip file. cd into this directory from the terminal, and the run
    ./autogen.sh
   When the     ./autogen.sh     script is done running, run
    make
   And, finally, run
    sudo make install
   Step 1.4: Installing libusbmuxd
   This step is similar to the previous step, except we are installing     libusbmuxd  instead of
    libplist .
   First, download the latest version of      libusbmuxd   from GitHub. Again, extract the contents to
   a directory, and cd to the directory       libusbmuxd-master  . Then run the following:
    ./autogen.sh
   When this is finished, run
    make
   followed by
    sudo make install
   Step 1.5: Installing libimobiledevice
   First, install the build dependencies by doing the following:
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
   Then download the latest version of libimobiledevice from GitHub. Extract as in the
   previous two steps; you should get a directory inside the directory to which you extracted
   called libimobiledevice-master . cd into this directory, and, again, run
    ./autogen.sh
   When this is finished, run
    make
   followed by
    sudo make install

   Step 1.6: Installing a better version of usbmuxd
   First, uninstall the old version of  usbmuxd  by doing
    sudo apt-get remove usbmuxd
   Then, install the build dependencies by doing
    sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-dev libplist-dev libusb-dev libusb-1.0.0-dev
    libtool-bin libtool
   Then, download the latest version of     usbmuxd   from GitHub. Extract and   cd  to the usbmuxd-
   master directory. Again, run
    ./autogen.sh
   When this is finished, run
    make
   followed by
    sudo make install
   Step 1.7: Installing ifuse
   This is the last thing you will need to install!
   First install, the build dependencies by doing
    sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev
   Download the latest version of ifuse from GitHub. Extract it to some directory, and         cd
   into the directory ifuse-master , and cd into that directory.
   This time there is an extra step in building the program. Do
    ./autogen.sh
   as usual, but then do
    ./configure
   as well. Then, continue on to the normal
    make
   and
    sudo make install
   Step 2: Running usbmuxd and attaching iPhone
   This step is simple. Run   usbmuxd  in the terminal, and then plug in the iPhone.
   Now check to see if the device was recognized correctly by doing
    dmesg | grep ipheth
   If nothing shows up, try disconnecting the iPhone, running      usbmuxd   again, and then plugging
   back in. Then check again.
   Step 3: Creating a mount point for the iPhone
   You can manually create a mount point for the iPhone by doing
    sudo mkdir /media/iPhone
   You will then likely want to change the permissions for the mount point. Do
    sudo chmod 777 /media/iPhone
   Step 4: Editing the ifuse configuration file
   The ifuse configuration file     /etc/fuse.conf    requires editing if you want to access the
   iPhone without being root.
   Edit the configuration file using your favorite editor, for example gedit
    sudo gedit /etc/fuse.conf

12/18/2017                                                          usb - How can I mount my iPhone 6s on Ubuntu 16.04? - Ask Ubuntu
   In the file ensure that the following two lines are under the line that says                         # Allow non-root
   users to specify the allow_other or allow_root mount options :
    op$
    user_allow_other
   Save the file and quit the editor.
   Step 5: Pairing the iPhone
   Run the following line in order to pair your iPhone using                       idevicepair    :
    idevicepair pair
   Step 6: Mounting with ifuse
   Run the following line to mount the device at the mount point specified earlier:
    ifuse /media/iPhone
   NOTE: At this point you may mount the root filesystem if you have your phone jailbroken by
   doing the following line instead
    ifuse /media/iPhone/ --root
   The iPhone should now be accessible at                   /media/iPhone       through your file browser.
   When you want to unmount, do the following two lines
    fusermount -u /media/iPhone/
    idevicepair unpair
   These steps were adapted for xenial from this tutorial at dedoimedo, then further modified
   to suit devices with iOS 9+.

     After having built new versions of libplist, libusbmuxd, libimobiledevice, ifuse and
     usbmuxd under /usr/local/lib, those versions have to be taken into use when calling the
     commands to connect the iPhone (instead of using the old library versions, which is done
     by default). So I did the following in a bash-shell (make sure to unlock (enter your code or
     use your fingerprint) your iPhone before each action):
      sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib usbmuxd
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
      idevicepair pair
      ifuse /media/iPhone

   It seems that with iOS 10.2 Apple has broken it again. To fix:
      1. Download from GitHub latest versions of:                    libplist    ,  libusbmuxd    , libimobiledevice    ,
          ifuse and usbmuxd
      2. Extract ZIP files in a folder that you like, enter in each directory and launch compilation
         of the corresponding library (if you don't know how to do, just follow instructions inside
         the readme file inside each lib and remember that the development version of openssl

        is called libssl-dev when required). Please note that last command 'sudo make install'
        should put compiled libraries in /usr/local/lib .
     3. Make sure that environment vars point to this new versions rather than the old ones
        included in official packages:
         sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib usbmuxd
         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
     4. Connected your iOS 10.2 device to your computer:
         idevicepair pair
     5. Select "Trust" to the warning "Trust This Computer?" on your device:
         idevicepair pair
     6. Mount the iOS filesystem
         ifuse Mountpoint_Directory/
